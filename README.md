# Reactive_Traffic_Lights
Emergency Vehicle Smart Grid

When emergency vehicles are deployed in big cities with a lot of traffic, they tend to get caught in traffic jams, which delays the response time. 

Our approach was to implement reactive agents to better manage the traffic grid with respect to emergency vehicles.

We give priority to emrgency vehicle for the traffic lights and also we give them smart shortest path to reach the goals faster.

Implementation of basic agents' structure in python code (For more complex agent systems, an agent frameworkm should be use).

Sumo and traci python api were the main tools of this project
